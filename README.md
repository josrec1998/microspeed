# microspeed

This program calculates the speed of wheels on either the right or left hand side of a buggy connected to a quadrature encoder. This is achieved by the joysticks altering the speed then checking this matches the one registered by the encoders. This work involved a STM32 microcontroller and a power board used to drive the motors on the wheels.
